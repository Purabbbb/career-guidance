-------------
Evidence-based Resume Roast LLM client for MargDarshak.

This module generates SAVAGE, BRUTAL, WITTY, COMEDIC, DARK-HUMORED roasts
grounded entirely in actual resume content.

Features:
- Always generates SAVAGE tone (no gentle/balanced options)
- Evidence-based roasting (every joke references actual resume content)
- Resume-specific (never generates generic template roasts)
- Structured output with sources
- Supports multiple LLM providers or high-quality deterministic fallback

Safety rules:
- Roast targets RESUME WRITING, NEVER the person
- No comments on race, gender, religion, appearance, nationality, or protected traits
- Professional, constructive, witty career critique
- Dark humor but not hateful or abusive
